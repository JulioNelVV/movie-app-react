This is a movie app created using React Js as the UI core library, react-wouter library for the dynamic routing and the SPA behaviour and the native Fetch API for fetching the data from The Movie Database server (you can learn more about The movie Datebase in: [The movie database website](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=es)).

# # Structure of the App

The App has 2 types of view, the general view in which you can see the most popular movies, genres movies or search an movie by a keyword; and the other view is the deatils view where you can find the most relevant informafion about an specific movie. You can surf the different pages of every view using navigation buttons, and you can see a manual or automatic slider at the top of the App showing the four (it's a customizable number) most popular movies.
